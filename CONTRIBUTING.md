### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
* Follow the Python style guide (PEP 8)
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured tests
* Document new code
* End all files with a newline

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diagram-generator.git
   cd diagram-generator
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov black isort mypy
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in a new git branch
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Ensure the test suite passes:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Format your code:
   ```bash
   black src tests
   isort src tests
   ```

5. Run type checking:
   ```bash
   mypy src
   ```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add support for Azure cloud components

- Import Azure components from diagrams package
- Update NODE_TYPES mapping in diagram_builder.py
- Add Azure examples to documentation
- Update tests to cover new components

Fixes #123
```

### Testing

* Write tests for any new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
* Test files should be in `tests/` mirroring the `src/` structure

Example test:
```python
import pytest
from src.agents.diagram_agent import DiagramAgent

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_diagram_generation():
    agent = DiagramAgent(use_mock=True)
    result = await agent.generate_diagram("Create a simple web app")
    
    assert result["success"] is True
    assert "diagram_path" in result
    assert result["nodes_created"] > 0
```

### Documentation

* Update the README.md if needed
* Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
* Update API documentation for new endpoints
* Include examples for new features

### Style Guide

#### Python Style

* Follow PEP 8
* Use type hints for function parameters and returns
* Maximum line length: 100 characters
* Use descriptive variable names
* Prefer f-strings over .format() or %

#### Logging

Always use the dual-tag logging system:

```python
from src.core.logging import logger, FeatureTag, ModuleTag

logger.info(
    "Processing diagram request",
    feature=FeatureTag.API,
    module=ModuleTag.API_ENDPOINTS,
    request_id=request_id,
    description=description[:50]
)
```

#### Error Handling

Use proper error handling with meaningful messages:

```python
try:
    result = await generate_diagram(description)
except ValidationError as e:
    logger.error(
        "Validation failed",
        feature=FeatureTag.TOOLS,
        module=ModuleTag.TOOL_VALIDATOR,
        error=str(e)
    )
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

## Project Structure

When adding new features, follow the existing structure:

* `src/api/` - API endpoints and models
* `src/agents/` - Agent implementations
* `src/tools/` - Tools and utilities
* `src/llm/` - LLM integrations
* `src/core/` - Core functionality (config, logging)
* `src/utils/` - Helper functions and decorators
